### Dependabot Configuration

Add a dependabot.yml file to the .github directory to configure Dependabot for your project. You can specify the package ecosystems, directory, and schedule for updates. Here's an example configuration:
```yaml
version: 2
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: "npm" # npm, pip, maven, etc.
    directory: "/" # Location of package manifests
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly" # Options: daily, weekly, monthly
```


### Create a workflows directory for GitHub Actions

Create a directory named .github/workflows in your repository to store your GitHub Actions workflow files. This is where you will define the automation tasks for your project.

```yaml
### Example GitHub Actions Workflow

Create a YAML file in the .github/workflows directory to define a GitHub Actions workflow. Here's an example of a simple workflow that runs tests on push and pull request events:

```yaml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
    build:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
        steps:
        - name: Checkout code
            uses: actions/checkout@v2
    
        - name: Set up Node.js
            uses: actions/setup-node@v3
            with:
            node-version: '19   '
    
        - name: Install dependencies
            run: npm install
    
        - name: Run tests
            run: npm test
```
